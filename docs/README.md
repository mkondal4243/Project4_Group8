# SecureLink â€“ Smart Home Security System

SecureLink is a C++ and Qt-based smart home security system. It provides a graphical user interface to monitor and control simulated smart devices like door locks, garage, lights, and cameras. The app connects to a server using TCP sockets, handles user login, transfers log files, and displays motion alerts in real-time.

## Features

- Login system using socket-based authentication
- Dashboard to control and monitor smart devices
- Motion alert simulation and log export
- Log file transfer from server to client
- Server status indicator (live, reconnecting, offline)
- SQLite database to store access logs and login attempts
- Built with Qt for a modern GUI experience

---
